This is a very simple URL resolver. Put it up at a short domain for a
URL shortener, or add features to create a more advanced ID resolver.

In the Apache config file for your host (or vhost) turn on rewrite and
point all requests at a resolver script. Carve out exceptions for
requests to / and /error, allowing for the index and error pages:
 
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteMap id_map prg:/path/to/resolver.py
  RewriteRule ^/$ index.html [L]
  RewriteRule ^/error$ error.html [L]
  RewriteRule ^/(*)$ ${id_map:$1} [L,QSA]

Name -> Target pairs can be created in a Python interpreter for now.
